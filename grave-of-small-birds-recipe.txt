Grave of Small Birds

Recipe by Daniel Myers

A very simple chicken dish, being meat cooked in wine with seasonings. The word "grav√©" is very likely the origin of the modern word "gravy".

1 lb. chicken thighs
1/2 cup red wine
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup cooked bacon pieces
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. ginger

Place all ingredients in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then simmer until done - about 20 minutes.
